Freedom muscle node JS app. 


This was one of my very first attempts at using NodeJS. Since then I have definetly started to break things into multiple files like a normal person! I really enjoyed this project because time management is something I am passionate about. This app uses Twillio to send text messages out to a user when they fail to review their goals each day. 

After I got the basics working, I moved onto other projects. But someday I intend to come back and redue this whole project. I think the use of automated text messages has incredible potential for different applications. 

This app also involved some of my early playing around with Postgres.
